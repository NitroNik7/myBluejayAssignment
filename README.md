# myBluejayAssignment

Dear Sir/Ma'am, I have solved the assignment using Java. You can run the jar file of the Project stored at : [JAR file path](https://github.com/NitroNik7/myBluejayAssignment/blob/master/dist/BluejayDelivery.jar) using the command
```
java -jar BluejayDelivery.jar
``` 

I have saved the `Console output` in the output.txt file. Also, I have added `comments` wherever necessary. I request you to please consider my project.
